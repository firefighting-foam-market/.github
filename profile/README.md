    <strong>Industry Trends and Drivers:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rising Industrial Fire Incidents:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    That fire incidents have had a rise and rise in the industrial sectors are a
    great demography factor influencing the adoption of firefighting foam. The
    oil and gas, chemical manufacturing and energy sectors often have processes
    that are inherently prone to fires and explosions due to their products and
    materials. The bush fires that occur in these sectors are complex and large
    and hence require effective means to extinguish the fires to prevent large
    casualty figures. High expansion foam is being promoted in those high risk
    sectors for its area coverage and rapid fire knock down, and is seeming to
    act like a ‘must have’ in the process. Further more, regulatory authorities
    in many nations are increasing their expectations for the application of
    effective fire suppression systems in industries. This push for improved
    ‘safety compliance’ is therefore creating demand for the use of firefighting
    foam as a reliable solution. In this context, emerging industries combined
    with new economies creating the worlds developing economies are creating
    fire risk situations that can only be addressed by firefighting foam.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Increased Awareness of Fire Safety:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Awareness towards fire safety is one of the major aspects that is likely to
    drive faster growth in the marketplace. This increase in awareness brings
    about increased safety demands as a result of the significant loss of
    property and lives associated with fire hazards which creates a demand and
    deployable outlet for more advanced fire extinguishing systems in many
    areas. The public s awareness of fire safety has been increasingly
    stimulated through worldwide sites, such as government entities, community
    organizations and fire safety associations development, many governments
    around the world become stricter and stricter on fire safety. Society is
    demanding high performance fire fighting and foam based systems.
    Furthermore, through regular fire awareness initiatives and preventative
    educational workshops, there is an improvement in fire-related awareness
    disparity between the public and industry. Fire fighting foam has proven
    itself as an effective and versatile firefighting tool with an extremely
    short time of operations; consequently, it is gaining acceptance in fire
    protection schemes. This shift toward preparedness and prevention also is
    creating an opportunity for both enterprises and the general public to
    invest in better fire suppression technologies.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Innovation in Foam Formulations:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The market is beneficiary from the present technology proliferation in foam
    formulations. As the environment entails more concern, manufacturers are
    creating considerably improved and more effective classes of firefighting
    foams that pollute little or not at all. The previous generation of
    fluorinated foams are facing criticism concerning their environmental
    impacts, while new fluoro-carbon free and bio-sourced foams are out. These
    new blends are also compliant with environmental regulations on emissions
    without sacrificing fire extinguishing performance – a metric that reflects
    their desirability in the industries with the most environmental concern. In
    addition, there are more signs that sophisticated combinations are advancing
    in order to create Type of Foam to extinguish specific classes of fires,
    which includes; Class-A, Class-B and Class-C fires. These formulations
    increase firefighting competency in many areas and uses such as chemical and
    oil type fires, residential and commercial fires, etc.
